{"name":"Materials Data Curation System User Community","tagline":"","body":"### Purpose\r\n\r\nThis github organization was created to serve as a single portal for schemas, tools, and other resources in support of the [Materials Data Curation System](https://mgi.nist.gov/materials-data-curation-system). If you are a user of the Materials Data Curation System, you are encouraged to participate! If you are interested in being a contributor or an editor of the community, please contact one of the current editors:\r\n\r\n* [Laura Bartolo](https://github.com/lbartolo)\r\n* [Glenn Tarcea](https://github.com/gtarcea)\r\n* [Zachary Trautt](https://github.com/ztrautt)\r\n\r\n### Repositories and Projects\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to host your repository within the organization or we can link to it below. Current repositories include:\r\n\r\n* [Development of modular data models for materials science (include)](https://github.com/MDCS-community/modular-data-models-include) - Modular data models for materials science, where reusable types are assembled via include statements. Once supported by the MDCS, modular data models will be transitioned to import statements with version controlled name space declarations.\r\n\r\n* [MDCS API Tools](https://github.com/MDCS-community/MDCS-api-tools) - Command line tool and python package for using the Materials Data Curation System Application Programming Interface. \r\n\r\n* [Tutorials](https://github.com/MDCS-community/tutorials) - Materials for educational outreach and learning. \r\n\r\n### Rules and code of conduct\r\n\r\nThe MDCS Community is a collaborative space for researchers and developers. We are developing models, schemas and tools for the Materials community and the\r\nMaterials Genome Initiative (MGI). While healthy discussions are encouraged our community works in a collaborative fashion. Our codes of conduct and rules\r\nare a community driven effort and are still in development. \r\n\r\n### Values\r\n\r\nThese are the values our community aspires to:\r\n\r\n* Friendly and welcoming\r\n* Patience - take the time to explain to new members\r\n* Thoughtful and respectful\r\n* Collaborative\r\n* Innovative\r\n* Diversity of people, opinions and approaches\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
