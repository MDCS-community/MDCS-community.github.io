### Purpose

This github organization was created to serve as a single portal for schemas, tools, and other resources in support of the [Materials Data Curation System](https://mgi.nist.gov/materials-data-curation-system). If you are a user of the Materials Data Curation System, you are encouraged to participate! If you are interested in being a contributor or an editor of the community, please contact one of the current editors:

* [Laura Bartolo](https://github.com/lbartolo)
* [Glenn Tarcea](https://github.com/gtarcea)
* [Zachary Trautt](https://github.com/ztrautt)

### Projects

You are welcome to host your repository within the organization or we can link to it below. Current projects include:

* [Development of modular data models for materials science (include)](https://github.com/MDCS-community/modular-data-models-include) - Modular data models for materials science, where reusable types are assembled via include statements. Once supported by the MDCS, modular data models will be transitioned to import statements with version controlled name space declarations.

### Rules and code of conduct

The MDCS Community is a collaborative space for researchers and developers. We are developing models, schemas and tools for the Materials community and the
Materials Genome Initiative (MGI). While healthy discussions are encouraged our community works in a collaborative fashion. Our codes of conduct and rules
are a community driven effort and are still in development. 

### Values

These are the values our community aspires to:

* Friendly and welcoming
* Patience - take the time to explain to new members
* Thoughtful and respectful
* Collaborative
* Innovative
* Diversity of people, opinions and approaches
